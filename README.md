Hello there :)

This is an intitative that introduces a virtual exhibition platform designed to empower artisans and craftspeople by bridging the gap between them and global customers. 

Recognizing the rich heritage of indigenous crafts in India, our platform aims to provide direct market access to these talented individuals, eliminating expensive middlemen and fostering a more equitable Craftsman-to-Customer (B2C) model. Typically, craftspeople take their goods to an exhibition or “haat” to sell to patrons directly; here, we aim to digitize the “haat” experience to provide artists a platform to sell their goods to domestic and global buyers.

Currently the platform is under development stage where we have managed to create components through which a user can create their own exhibitions , add stalls which facilitates the option of uploading their photos of interest . The user can also preview their exhibition to change and edit as they need it to be , whereas the index page contains all stored exhibitions from the database that were created by all user.

Additionally , we are working on the following : 
- 
  - Uploads of all kinds of multimedia files , 
  * sync the timing of exhibition to real time for live visibility , 
  * Integrate Augmented Reality into the products displayed to give an immersive experience for creators , buyers and sellers.


The tools used to build this : ReactJS , Vite , Node , MongoDB , Tailwind CSS , AWS S3 Bucket,Vercel, and Github .
